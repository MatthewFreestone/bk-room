# BK Reservations
The normal registration system limits how far ahead you can reserve a study room, and restricts a single reservation to 3 hours.  
This system allows you to reserve a room much further in advance, and for longer periods of time.
Errors are not always handled properly, since it relies of the other system. If in doubt, open DevTools and see if there's anything there.
